  GALAXY PARAMETERS
  NEW in v1.4:

  The ionizing efficiency zeta is allowed to scale with the halo mass:
  \zeta = N_{\gammaUV} x f_{esc} x f_{\ast}

  where:
  f_{\ast} = STELLAR_BARYON_FRAC x (M_{halo}/10^10 M_{sol})^STELLAR_BARYON_PL
  f_{esc} = ESC_FRAC x (M_{halo}/10^10 M_{sol})^ESC_PL

  The number of halos hosting active galaxies (i.e. the duty cycle) is assumed to
  exponentially decrease below M_TURNOVER Msun, : fduty \propto e^(- M_TURNOVER / M)

  See eq. (?) in Park et al....

  The fiducial 2 parameter galaxy model with a constant specific ionizing luminosity down
  to a threshold halo mass, M_TURNOVER, is recovered by setting *_PL parameters to zero.
  This results in the fastest runs.
  NOTE: In 21CMMC all these parameters are free parameters except N_GAMMA_UV.

  field is extreemly insensitive to this choice)
 
  If setting IHOMO_RECO below to 1, R_BUBBLE_MAX should be at least ~20Mpc,
  physically corresponding to the mfp at the end of the EoR.

  bins the density field on scale DIM/HII_DIM, similar to what Lagrangian codes do 
  when constructing Eulerian grids. In other words, the density field, \delta,
  is quantized into (DIM/HII_DIM)^3 values. If your usage requires smooth density fields,
  it is recommended to set SMOOTH_EVOLVED_FIELD to 1.  This also decreases the shot noise
  present in all grid based codes, though it overcompensates by an effective loss in resolution.

  a good approximation at the <~10% level.  Future builds will include the mao+ model for
